## Welcome to NextWaveData 🏄🏼‍♀️📊
 
Hi, I am Giulia, a Data Scientist with a background in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Economics.

 🔭  About Me
- I’m fascinated by how AI can support people in solving problems that once seemed insurmountable, and I’m always curious about the latest developments in the field.
- I love turning data into actionable insights, from everyday personal finance to complex business challenges with large-scale impact.
- My interests span across Data Science and Cybersecurity, two areas where data and technology play a key role in shaping the future.


🤸🏼‍♀️ Outside of work, you’ll often find me doing sports, from horse riding to surfing, or simply training at the gym.
